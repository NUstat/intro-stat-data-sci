## Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for **Introduction to Statistics and Data Science**. This book starts you down the path of learning how to think with data using R. You'll learn the basics of how to engage, explore, and examine many types of data arising from several contexts. Hopefully you'll have fun and see how valuable it is to be able to critically think with data.
